Attempting to do LLVM 9/10 code generation to get acquainted with it better since tutorials are lacking here. Following basic LLVM tutorials here http://releases.llvm.org/9.0.0/docs/tutorial/LangImpl03.html

Last tested and builds with LLVM/Clang 11, but only the `hello-world` directory, the others were tested with Clang 10.
